Mini Q&A Chatbot Assessment
This project is a simple, intelligent Q&A chatbot built for the Algorithm Aliens technical assessment. The chatbot is designed to answer a predefined set of questions and excels at understanding variations in user phrasing through the use of semantic similarity.

‚ú® Key Features
Answers a knowledge base of 15 predefined questions.

Handles phrasing variations: Understands that "What is the price?" and "How much does it cost?" have the same meaning.

Graceful Fallback: Responds with a polite "I don't know" message for irrelevant or out-of-scope questions.

Interactive UI: A clean and simple web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python

Hugging Face sentence-transformers: For generating state-of-the-art text embeddings.

Scikit-learn: For calculating cosine similarity.

Streamlit: For building the interactive web UI.

üìÅ Project Structure
The project is organized into logical modules for clarity and maintainability.

‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py             # Main Streamlit application file for the UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot.py         # Contains the core Minibot class and its logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge_base.py  # Stores the predefined list of questions and answers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # A list of all Python dependencies for the project

üöÄ Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to get the chatbot running on your local machine.

1. Setup and Installation
First, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-github-repo-link>
cd <your-project-directory>

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. How to Run
Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

This will open a new tab in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.

##üß† My Approach
The core requirement of this task was to handle variations in user questions. To achieve this, I chose a Semantic Search approach over simple keyword matching. Here‚Äôs how it works:

Knowledge Base: I began by defining the 15 required questions and answers in knowledge_base.py.

Text Embeddings: I used the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Hugging Face's sentence-transformers library. This powerful model converts each question in the knowledge base into a 384-dimensional numerical vector (an "embedding"). These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text. This is a one-time process performed when the chatbot initializes.

Real-time Query Processing: When a user submits a question, it is also converted into an embedding using the same model.

Cosine Similarity: The chatbot then calculates the cosine similarity between the user's query vector and all the pre-calculated vectors in the knowledge base. This provides a score of how "semantically close" the user's question is to each known question.

Thresholding for Relevance: The question with the highest similarity score is chosen as the best match. However, to handle completely unrelated questions, I implemented a threshold (0.5). If the top score is below this threshold, the bot concludes the question is out of scope and returns a default "I don't know" response.

This method is highly effective and robust, ensuring the chatbot provides accurate answers even when users phrase their questions in unexpected ways.
